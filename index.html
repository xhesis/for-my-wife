    <p>
you may know me as someone who doesn't really have that much money to spend but when i do, i'll go on a spending spree on things that i know you'll like. unfortunately for me, i couldn't save up enough money to buy you a gift this valentine's :') . i don't know if you'll accept this or not or what your reaction will be but, i thought that i'd reserve a tiny nook of space in the internet that i can dedicate my love for you in. so welcome! this is for you, my love.

you make everything better. every situation, every fight, every argument whatever it is we face, you make better, whatever it is we're dealing with, you're the reason i always choose to get through that. tomorrow is our 5th monthsary, and i'm so glad that i've spent the last 5 months with you. and in a month from tomorrow, it'll be our 6th. that's half a year with you!! and i can't wait to spend more months and years with you. i really like your smile, not just like, i really love it too. it's not something that i just say to make you feel better or to give you butterflies. it's a confession. and i'm also not talking just about smiles. i confess, my love, that everything about you has turned me into a person that i never expected i'd become. whether i'm worse than before or not, i still believe that behind everything that's bad is something that's inherently good. i love the way your hair smells whenever it's in my face, i love how just looking at your eyes make me cry and tear up, i love how jealous i get being with you because it shows you how much i actually care about you and how much i don't want to lose you. i love how your touch makes me feel so cared for and so much horny as well. i love how your kiss instantly makes me feel better, and i haven't told you about that yet but i'm telling you now because you need to know what kind of effects you have on me. i love every piece you, including the ones that make me feel like you're close, even when you're not. i love how you still accept me even when i believe myself to be unacceptable and unworthy of you. nathalie, chloe, baby, wifey, love, darling, dear, sweetheart, i'll love you always whoever you may become.
